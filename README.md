About
-----
This is a firmware for AVR microcontrollers with USB device support like the Teensy to simulate a keyboard and a mouse. It was created for a custom split keyboard design with 4x6 keys on each side in a matrix layout but could be adapted easily for other hardware.

By default, it implements a different, more ergonomic layout without any further drivers on any host operating system. In its current state, the well evolved [AdNW layout][adnw] is implemented with modified layers 3&4 (special characters, navigational keys and numpad) from the [neo layout][neo]. In addition, an integrated IBM trackpoint is also supported, but any PS/2 compatible device can also be hooked-up to the controller.

This is my daily driver since about 2 years now:

A presentation of my current keyboard prototype can be found [here][DT_hw], where you'll also find more detailed information on the hardware and the layout used as well as discussions related to these project.

Features
--------
- Full macro support with all configuration done on the keyboard itself, no external tools needed.
- 2nd-Use modifier keys acting as normal keys when toggled by themselves.
- PS/2 protocol for pointing devices
- Mouse device with 3 buttons and 2 scrollwheels
- IBM trackpoint configuration
- Supports multiple layouts in switchable layers
- Native support for different host keyboard language settings, qwertz and qwerty implemented
- HMAC-SHA1 based string generatiom for safer passwords

Credits
-------
USB device support depends on the [LUFA][lufa] framework by Dean Camera.

The driver was originally based on humblehackers [hhkb firmware][hhkb], but I found some things (while pretty neat and cleanly implemented) a little too difficult to adjust, so I revamped everything but the most basic USB code.

Implementation of mousekey layer, KEYMAP macro and other neat ideas borrowed from the very advanced [tmk_firmware][tmk].

Klaus Weber contributed greatly to an enhanced secondary use state machine and provided several other modifications, including alternate layouts as well as PC/Mac and host language differentiations.

PS/2 support is copied from [TMK sources][tmk] so uart and interrupt based code should hopefully also work in the future.

A dedicated USB ID was generously supplied by Openmoko, Inc.

Password hash generation is implemented after the algorithm from the Android apps [Twik][twik_android] ([python implementation here][twik_python]) and [HashIt!][hashit_android], which in turn are based on the chrome extension Password Hasher Plus.

It uses hmac-sha1 and sha1 implementations from [avr-crypto-lib][avr_crypto_lib], licensed under GPL3.

License
-------
Unless otherwise mentioned all code is licensed under GPL3.
External code may use a different license which should be declared in the relevant files.

**If you create a firmware from this code you _must_ change the vendor and product id!**

Install
-------
You will need a recent version of the [LUFA][lufa] usb stack to compile this software.

    $ git submodule init
    $ git submodule update


To build, please adjust controller type and build switches in makefile.
The hardware wiring needs to be specified in matrix.h .
Further configuration can be achieved by editing src/config.h .

Valid ids can be retrieved from AVR demoes, or the keyboard examples of the LUFA lib.

Then simply call

    $ make

To build for a different hardware, either edit KB_HW in makefile or export via environment:

    $ make HW_KB=REDTILT


Command Mode Keys
-----------------
For a full list of commands refer to handleCommand() in [command.c](/src/command.c) :

- v Version info
- q Quit command mode where possible
- b Jump to bootloader 
- t TrackPoint info output
- l Alternate layer toggle
- m Mouse toggle

The following commands need further input:
- x Execute macro 
    * Press key to playback its macro

- r Record macro (see number/length limits in [macro.h](/src/macro.h)
    * Press key to record macro for
    * Type in macro slowly
    * <Ctrl>+<Esc> aborts, <Ctrl>+<Return> saves, <Alt>+<Return> insert pause
    
- h PassHash
    * Enter tag [length [mode]] for passhash creation


Password Hash Support
---------------------
Support for passwords compatible with PassHash implementations, for example the android app Twik, 
must be configured in a separate header:
Twik private key of a profile and master password can be set in src/_private_data.h, 
which is created on first make call and ignored in git.


Current Layout
==============
Current default layout as implemented in [keymap.h](/src/keymap.h) : 
( discussion at [deskthority][DT_layout] and as a [graphical layout][RT_AdNW] )
